Hello there! If you're reading this that means that you either forked Zora or are viewing the files, no need to worry, this is the open GPL version, meaning that it is: open-source!
You have the right to:
  Modify
  Distribute
  Private use
  Commercial use
  Patent use*

But, if you decide to do any of these, you must meet the conditions as follows:
  Disclose source:
    Source code must be made available when license material is distributed
  License and Copyright notice:
    license and copyright notice must be included with material
  Network use IS distribution:
    Users who interact with the licensed material via network are given the right to recieve a       copy of the source code
  Same license:
    Modifications must be released under a similar, related, or the same license when  
    distributing the licensed material
  State changes:
    Changes made to the licensed material must be documented

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If users are found to not comply though, Tomoko or Meisei hold the right to seek compensation or a recall of the product as not following any of the conditions is in violation of the license.

*users who copy source-code cannot patent Meisei or Tomoko functions (pieces of code written by them), users also cannot remove the copyright or license file from the program, as that will also be a violation.
